# Getting Started with Mathematics Research References

Welcome to the Mathematics Research References collection. This guide will help you understand how to navigate and use this repository effectively.

## Overview

This repository is a structured collection of mathematical research references organized by field and document type. It provides a way to quickly find, access, and manage important mathematical literature.

## How to Navigate

### Using the Tree Structure

The repository follows a tree structure similar to how Tree-sitter organizes code analysis:

1. **By Field**: Navigate to the `/fields/` directory to browse references by mathematical area
   - Algebraic Geometry
   - Algebraic Stacks
   - Category Theory
   - TQFT
   - And more...

2. **By Type**: Navigate to the `/types/` directory to browse references by document type
   - Books
   - Research Papers
   - Notes
   - Preprints

3. **Documentation**: The `/docs/` directory contains guides on how to use this collection

### Using Search

You can use GitHub's search functionality to find specific references:

1. Press `s` or `t` while on the repository page
2. Type keywords related to what you're looking for
3. Use qualifiers like `filename:tqft` to narrow your search

## How to Use References

Each reference includes:

- **Basic metadata**: Author, title, year, source
- **Brief description**: What the reference covers
- **Tags**: Keywords for categorization
- **Notes**: Personal insights or summaries
- **Links**: To other related references or external resources

## Adding New References

To add your own references:

1. Choose the appropriate location (field or type)
2. Follow the established format:
   ```markdown
   # Title of Reference

   ## Metadata
   - **Author(s):** Name(s)
   - **Year:** Publication year
   - **Source:** Journal/Conference/Publisher
   - **Tags:** #tag1 #tag2 #tag3

   ## Description
   Brief description of the reference.

   ## Key Points
   - Important point 1
   - Important point 2
   - Important point 3

   ## Notes
   Your personal notes about this reference.

   ## Related References
   - [Related Reference 1](path/to/reference1.md)
   - [Related Reference 2](path/to/reference2.md)
   ```

3. Create cross-references by linking to related references

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for using this repository:

1. **Search for a topic**: Look for "category theory" or "homological algebra"
2. **Browse relevant references**: Check both field-specific and document-type listings
3. **Read descriptions and notes**: Get a quick overview before diving into the full reference
4. **Follow links**: Explore related references to build a comprehensive understanding
5. **Add your own notes**: Contribute your insights to enhance the collection

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Use consistent tags**: This helps with searching and categorization
- **Create comprehensive metadata**: More details make references easier to find
- **Link liberally**: Connect related concepts across different references
- **Add personal insights**: Don't just collect references, add your understanding
- **Update regularly**: Mathematical research evolves, keep your references current
